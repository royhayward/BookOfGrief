# Faith and Grief

## Where is God when I'm in such pain?

If you are a person with great faith in God or a person with just a passing familiarity with religion you may wonder where is God when you are suffering with grief. I know that I was shocked at how I felt when I was dealing with my grief. It's not easy to explain.

My relationship with God is something that effects all aspects of my life. I know that He lives and have felt his influence in my life as an almost constant and ever present influence. That is, until I lost a child.

After that, I felt an absence. I remembered feeling God. But it was like picking up a phone and not hearing the dial tone. You know that making a call will be useless. My phone was broken.

This didn't cause me to lose my faith in God. Not everyone has this experience. I know others that when their moment of grief came felt closer to God than ever before. Feeling farther or closer to God doesn't change how much you cry, or how much you hurt, or how much you need to talk and share and listen.

A few weeks later for me, while driving home from work, I suddenly felt God answering my prayers with his peace. I pulled over and cried again. This time it wasn't from the pain. It was from the joy of having God back in my heart again.

It's not unreasonable to ask, "Where was God while I was in such pain?" If we have faith in God we believe that he is supposed to help us when we need him and comfort us when we suffer. And it can be very upsetting if we don't feel him when we are in our moment of grief.

After my experience, I had a better understanding of why the loss of a loved one causes some people to stop believing. Or causes them to be angry with God. I know that god was still with my family. He was working so hard to help us. I believe that my heart was in such pain and that my soul was crying so loudly that I could not hear his comfort.

Each of us will experience grief in our own way on some level. You may not go through what I did.

## How does having faith help me grieve?

Most people of faith have a belief in the after life. We believe that when this life ends, there is more later. An after life, or reward. This will effect the way we approach grief.

If you have faith in God and believe in an after life, you probably have a church that you can go to and find people there to talk to. Dealing with grief and loss is one of the primary purposes of religion. If you don't have a church that you attend, pick one and show up and simply ask if you can talk to someone. If that doesn't work, go to the next one.

Having faith that there is life beyond this life can give you hope. In your grief you may feel alone and have doubts. Talk to people that will re-enforce your hope and faith. This will give you strength.

## Is it too late find faith after I'm grieving?

If you have never had a use for God or religion in your life, but now that you are faced with loss feel that you would like to know about God it is not too late. It may be the perfect time. Find a friend or visit a church and talk to them. Find comfort where you can find it. Even if you don't develop faith that lasts.

Faith is a form of therapy. It is for me. I go to church each week. Some people only go a few times a year. If this is a time when you need to go to church every day, then that is what you need. Don't let how often you have visited church or talked to God in the past stop you from doing what you need to do now.

Church and prayer are like the doctor. Just because you have skipped the last five years of physicals doesn't mean the doctor can't help you when you have a broken arm. And just because you haven't prayed or gone to church for the last 5 years doesn't mean God and Church can't help you when your heart is broken.

This is about you dealing with loss and grief. Get the help you need from the people and places where you can get them. If someone tells you, or you are telling yourself, that you are only going to church because you lost a loved one, tell them right back that this is true and for them to hope you get the help you need.

## I have a friend that lost their faith when they started grieving.

I totally understand how this can happen. But if you remember the experience I related at the beginning of this chapter. I went through a period where I felt distant from God. Eventually we found our way back to each other. But it took time for me to be able to hear Him again.

This may or may not be what is happening to your friend. Just like our grief is personal and a little different for each of us. So our faith is also unique to each of us. So we should not try to fit your friend into the mold of another person.

Don't push them away or shun them. But you can ask them not to be negative about God when they are around you. Pray for them. Tell them you are praying for them. Keep praying for them if they tell you to stop, but don't tell them about it.

Don't be surprised if they are back in church in 5 years. But don't tell them that.

Don't be surprised if they are at another church in a few years. Don't fight about it.
