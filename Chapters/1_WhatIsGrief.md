# What is Grief?

## Grief is the suffering of loss.

Just like a person that is ill or injured, a person experiencing grief is also suffering. Grief is a pain that is internal. You may see it on another's face. Or hear it in their voice. But Grief doesn't show up on an x-ray or blood test. And there is no pill that makes it go away.

In regards to that pill idea. People have tried to medicate grief away. Alcohol and drugs are tried daily by people seeking a way out. I've never found that this works or is a long term solution. Instead of being a sad person, they become a sad, drunk person. When the drink or drug passes through their system, they are back dealing with the same grief again. Many times with additional problems caused by the drug or alcohol use.

Just like a person that is ill or injured, a person experiencing grief will heal and become adept at dealing with their grief over time. And in the same way as illness and injury, there are some activities that will help a person get better. And there are activities that will keep a person from getting better or make the process take longer.

I'm going to go into more detail about this in chapter 8, 9, and 10. But to start with, drinking, drugs and holding it all in are ways to make it take longer. Talking with people. Sometimes even yelling at people that will let you without taking it personally may help the healing process.

## Grief is normal.

Some people experience the grief of losing a loved one while they are very young. Others grow up and experience it after they are adults. Eventually, everyone experiences grief. Eventually everyone will have someone they love pass on.

When I was grieving, I felt alone. This feeling is normal and is wrong. You may feel like you are alone and that other people don't understand what you are feeling. But you are not alone. There are many others that have experienced the same loss that you have. Find these people in your group of friends and talk with them.

When my wife and I lost our child, we discovered that we had been inducted into the exclusive club of parents that had also lost children. This is an exclusive club, because the entry requirements are high. And this club doesn't recruit new members. A dozen of our friends came forward and visited with us and let us cry on their shoulders. We were not as alone as we thought.

In addition to this, we discovered that these friends of our were living normal lives. We didn't feel like things would ever be normal again. But we were talking with people that understood what we were feeling, ad been though it, and had come out still able to laugh and to smile, gave us hope.

It can give you hope too. You are not alone. What you are feeling is normal.

## Grief is healthy.

What would it be like if we didn't grieve? If we didn't have the aching pain that comes with the loss of a spouse or child, what would we be? I don't think we would like those people.

Grief helps us to transition to a place where we have the ability to deal with our loss. Without grief we would either be stuck. Unable to come to terms with loss. And never recognizing that a permanent change had happened. As much as grief is painful and unpleasant, without it we would not be able to be healthy nor adjusted to reality.

## Grief doesn't have to take over your life.

When I discovered the sub-set of my friends that has lost children. I discovered that I would eventually be able to look normal to other people. I would be able to interact with them in normal ways. And to all external people, be normal. The loss would not permanently take over my life.

When a loss first happens, it feels like it will overwhelm you forever. That things will never get back to normal. That you don't want things to get back to normal, but want to focus on this source of pain for the rest of you life as a tribute to how much the person that you have lost meant to you.

This feeling is normal, but that is not what is going to happen. You will begin to be able to live with the loss and pain after a while. You have been permanently changed, but not permanently broken. When you are more healed than injured, you will start to look uninjured to others.

There will be a time when you reach out to comfort a friend who has lost a loved one and share with them. And they will be surprised to learn that you understand their pain. They won't have known about your loss because you never shared that part of your life with them. Not because you were hiding it, but because it never came up.

Eventually, you will be stronger than your grief. You will have taken your life back. And your loss will only come out when you want to use it to help others.
