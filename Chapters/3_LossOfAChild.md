# Loss of a Child

## I lost a child.

When I tell people that I lost a child, somewhere in the back of my brain a scene from the movie "Medicine Man" plays out. "Have you ever lost something?" Sean Connery asks. "Your car keys, your wallet, or even a phone number?" And I feel that "Losing a Child" is a bit of an odd thing to say. After all, it's not like I misplaced him. He died while I held him surrounded by family at the hospital.

But telling people that your child died seems so harsh. Passed away seems nicer. Most of the time when I have to tell someone about my son, I want to be nice. I don't want an awkward moment. I want to give the person I'm talking to the information they need to understand my family and then move on.

When my son passed away after a short 24 hours of life things were rough. We discovered a group of our friends had also lost children. They helped us in a way only someone that has shared a similar pain can do. They listened and shared and cried with us. But I can't live my whole life crying on the shoulder of nice and patient people.

## Pain of missing a person.

If you are a parent, then you know that when you are expecting a child you are also expecting the experiences that go with ii. You are expecting to change diapers and cuddle and infant. You are expecting to take baby pictures and teach them to eat solid food. You are expecting to have birthdays and christmases and visits to relatives and first days of school and on and on and on. You are expecting a life.

No matter how long or short the time you have with them is, you are going to have unmet expectations. Part of missing a person that has passed away is grieving for them on each of these occasions. Much of this grieving is done in advance. Right after experiencing the death of a child I cried when I realized that I would never help him learn to walk or to hear him call be Dad.



## Pain of missing opportunities and life events.

Some of the advice that we received and followed was to keep our son a part of these occasions. On Christmas we hung a stocking for him. We didn't buy him presents, but we did keep him in our hearts. We have kept hanging his stocking each year.

We have a birthday for him. We buy a cake. Sometimes we give our other children a small gift from him.

But my wife helped us do something that I didn't know how to do. Every few months after he passed my wife would tell me things. "He would be crawling now." She said once, and we cried together. "He would be getting his first tooth now." She said, and we cried some more. "He would know how to talk." or, "He  would be walking now." and we would cry and remember him.

Now on his birthdays, my wife and I remember how old he would be and what he would be doing that year and the next. Would he be starting school? Would he be riding a bike or wanting to join a soccer or baseball team? Would he be dating? This alive in our minds and hearts.





## Keeping the memories alive.

My advice is to find a way to keep a loved one that has passed on in your life. Hang up pictures. Celebrate their birthday. Keep some momentoes of them around.

My greatest fear after my life started getting back to normal was that I would forget my son. When the pain of loss started to get better, not really go away but to be something I could bear, I worried that I would forget and not remember him. And then, one day, I would remember and realize that it had been years since I had remembered him. I didn't want this to happen.
