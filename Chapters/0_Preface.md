## Preface:

### What is this book about?

This book is about grief.

It's something that we don't talk much about. Which is unusual sense loss of loved ones is universal to the human condition. Death is something that everyone will have to deal with. But if you are like me, you are unprepared to deal with the death of a child, a parent, a friend. And you are unprepared to deal with a friend who has suffered a loss of this kind.

You won't know what to say to people about your own loss. Or you won't know what to say to your friends that have suffered a loss. So you will back away and feel awkward around them. Or people may back away from you, and not know what to say to you, and you don't know what to say to them.

I hope to help you with this. It only takes a little understanding to bridge this gap.

### What is in this book?

In this book I've included some stories that are personal to me in my dealing with grief. I've also included some experiences related from others. But more than just a collection of stories, I've included the lessons learned, and as many options as I could to help people first to understand what is happening, and then giving some ideas of how to deal with it.


### Who is this book for?

I wrote this book with two people in mind.

The first person it is for is a younger version of myself that has suffered a recent loss. This person doesn't know how to deal with loss, and feels awash in a sea of tumultuous emotions. This is a painful time, and if we don't find a way to talk to others and communicate our feelings we are in trouble. This book if for that person. I hope it helps them to find the words and be able to reach out and express their feelings and get support and understanding.

The second person it is for is also a younger version of myself that has a friend that has suffered a recent loss. This person doesn't know how to relate to their friend, or how to talk to them. They are worried that anything they will say will make things worse. They are watching their friend drowning emotionally from the shore, but don't know how to bridge the gap that will allow them to be supportive and become an outlet for their friend. They can feel the separation building, but feel powerless to reach out. I hope to be able to help provide some understanding and to help this person to find the words to start the conversation, and then to listen and be supportive to a friend that has lost a loved one.

### How can you use this book?

This book is a starting place. In a few pages, I'm going to talk about how grief is a journey. So reading this book should give you a series of starting places for this journey. It will also give you some expectations about what might be down your path of grieving. If I could pick the best way for this book to be used, it would be shared. Parts of it be read and then discussed. Maybe even disagreed with and crossed out with a red pen.

If you are reading this book for yourself, or for a friend that suffered a loss. You may not have or feel like you can ask someone to read it and discuss it. If you are reading this book after suffering a loss, I hope this book will let you know that you are not alone. There are other people that have experienced what you are experiencing.

If you are reading this book to find a way to communicate with and connect with a friend or family member that has suffered a loss. Please use this book as a guide to what they might be experiencing and find a way to keep including them in your life and letting them have the time they need to communicate their feelings, and express their grief.

If you are reading this book and have a spouse or family member that has suffered the same loss. I hope you can read and discuss the sections of this book. Be critical of it, and use it as whipping boy. Talk about how it makes you feel to read the experiences of others that have suffered loss. Get a glimpse of people that have passed through what you are passing through and know that things can get better.
