# Loss of a Parent

## I lost a parent.

When I tell people that I lost my mother, somewhere in the back of my brain a scene from the movie "Medicine Man" plays out. "Have you ever lost something?" Sean Connery asks. "Your car keys, your wallet, or even a phone number?" And I feel that "Losing a Child" is a bit of an odd thing to say. After all, it's not like I misplaced her. She passed away after being uncocious for days with each of my brothers and sisters taking turns sitting by her side.

## Pain of missing a person.

Even though your parent is not a young child and has had a life that, among other things, brought you into the world, you will still miss that person. For me there are times when I wish that I could call and tell my Mom something that one of my kids did. Or listen to her go on about something political or hear her advice on something she thought I could do better at.

I don't think that it will matter how old I get. Each time one of my children gets an award or learns something new or does something naughty that is also new, on each of these occasions I want to tell my Mom. I also want to call her when something happens in my life. Each time I write a story or poem or change jobs or anything, I want to call my Mom and tell her.

If memory serves as a ruler, I want to tell my mom stuff more now that she is gone that I did when she was alive. My wife called her more than I did. But I knew that she was kept updated about my life. Now that she is gone I miss these moment.

## Pain of missing opportunities and life events.

For a while, I kept posting to my Mom's Facebook page. I know that some people used to, and still do, write journal or diary entries addressed to their departed parents. Some of the traditions that my Mom was most attached to have become my families traditions.

When my siblings and I get together for something, we mention that Mom or Dad would have liked this or that. We have tried to keep an annual campout going for several years now that was my Mom's favorite activity up to the year she died.



## Keeping the memories alive.
